## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focuse on just the features that affect the choice of top stations. I noticed that **Market St at 10th Street** and **Sain Fransisco Caltrain station 2** are the busiest stations aspecially at rush hours and weekdays. 
> On weekdays the start hours of rides tend to be in the morning around 8 am or in the evening around 5 pm, which means at rush hours. However, during weekends, the bicycle hires tend to be all the day with an importante bicycle hires the afternoon.
> As Thursday is the active day, San Fransisco Caltrain Station 2 is the busiest station aspecially between 6am and 9am. Thus; there should be enough number of bicycles at this time in this station. The second active day is Tuesday. The stations that are busy from 4 to 6pm are Montgomery St Bart and Powell St Bart.
